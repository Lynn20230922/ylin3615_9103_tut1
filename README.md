**Imaging Technique Inspiration**

My inspiration comes from **line art**, which is characterized by its abstraction and simplification. It reduces an image to lines while removing intricate details, thus emphasizing the subject, shapes, and contours. This approach offers a heightened level of clarity and expressiveness.

I used lines to recreate *“the scream”*, making this painting concise and powerful, full of dynamism and expressiveness.

**Coding Technique Exploration**

This code employs a particle system to create an image particle effect. It works as follows:

- The `initParticles` function generates a group of particles, configures their initial attributes, and adds them to the particles array. Each particle is assigned colors derived from the current image's pixel values.
- On the other hand, the `Particle` class defines the behavior of individual particles. It is responsible for creating particle objects, each equipped with properties like position, color, lifespan, and more.
